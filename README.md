### Node.js/io.js stuff
socket.io for client and server communication

Twilio integration for texting on page view. Scroll based to prevent reload activation

Facebook Graph API retrieves my photography page album metrics. I created nodes from like count and links when a person likes multiple albums. D3.js provided a force directed graph as a starting point. The cron retrieval runs daily.

Have a great day!
